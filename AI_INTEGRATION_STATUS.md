# ü§ñ AI Integration Status

## Current State

### ‚úÖ What's Implemented:
- Mood diary structure with data models
- Basic pattern analysis (Swift dictionaries)
- Trend detection (improving/stable/declining)
- Recommendation system
- Data structure ready for AI integration

### ‚ùå What's NOT Implemented Yet:
- **No Apple Foundation Models integration**
- **No Core ML models**
- **No Natural Language framework**
- Currently using simple Swift pattern matching

## Options for Integration

### Option 1: Core ML Integration
- Train/provide ML models for mood analysis
- On-device processing (privacy-friendly)
- Real machine learning predictions
- Requires ML model files (.mlmodel)

### Option 2: Natural Language Framework
- Use Apple's NLP for text analysis
- Sentiment analysis of user notes
- Pattern detection in emotions
- No external ML models needed

### Option 3: Apple Intelligence APIs (Future)
- Ready structure for when Apple Intelligence becomes available
- Most advanced AI capabilities
- Requires iOS 18+ and Apple Intelligence support

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
- Natural Language for text analysis
- Custom Swift logic for pattern detection
- Combined approach for best results

## Recommendation

For **App Store submission**, recommend **Option 2 (Natural Language)**:
- ‚úÖ Already available in iOS
- ‚úÖ No ML model files needed
- ‚úÖ Privacy-friendly (on-device)
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ Good enough for mood analysis

Would you like me to implement the Natural Language framework integration now?
