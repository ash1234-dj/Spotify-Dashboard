# 🍎 Apple Sign-In Error 1000 - Complete Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Your Current Error**
```
Apple Sign-In failed: The operation couldn't be completed. 
(com.apple.AuthenticationServices.AuthorizationError error 1000.)
```

**Error 1000 = `ASAuthorizationError.unknown`** - This typically indicates a **configuration issue**.

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Fix Process**

### **Step 1: Enable "Sign in with Apple" Capability (CRITICAL)**

This is the most common cause of error 1000:

1. **Open your Xcode project**
2. **Select your app target** (Music Story Companion)
3. **Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab**
4. **Click the "+ Capability" button**
5. **Search for and add "Sign In with Apple"**
6. **Verify it appears in the capabilities list**

❌ **If this capability is missing, you WILL get error 1000!**

### **Step 2: Configure Apple Developer Portal**

1. **Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)**
2. **Navigate to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"**
3. **Click "Identifiers" → Select your App ID**
4. **Scroll down and check "Sign In with Apple"**
5. **Click "Configure" next to it**
6. **Set it as "Primary App ID"**
7. **Save the configuration**

### **Step 3: Verify Bundle Identifier Match**

Ensure your Xcode bundle identifier **exactly matches** your Apple Developer Portal App ID:

**In Xcode:**
- Target → General → Bundle Identifier

**Must match exactly with Apple Developer Portal App ID**

### **Step 4: Clean and Rebuild**

1. **Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Delete app from device/simulator**
3. **Quit Xcode completely**
4. **Restart Xcode**
5. **Build and run fresh**

### **Step 5: Test on Physical Device (IMPORTANT)**

Apple Sign-In has different behavior on simulator vs device:
- ✅ **Test on real iOS device** for most accurate results
- ⚠️ **Simulator might have limitations**

### **Step 6: Check Apple ID Account**

- Use Apple ID with **two-factor authentication enabled**
- Ensure account is **not a child account**
- Try with **different Apple ID** if issues persist
- Make sure Apple ID is **signed in to Settings app**

## 🔧 **Enhanced Debugging (New in Your Code)**

I've added comprehensive logging to help diagnose issues. Check Xcode console output:

```swift
🍎 Starting Apple Sign-In with nonce: abc123...
🍎 Performing Apple authorization requests...
🍎 Apple authorization completed successfully
🍎 Successfully extracted Apple ID token
🍎 User ID: 001234.567890abcdef...
🔥 Signing in to Firebase with Apple credential...
✅ Firebase authentication successful
```

**If you see error logs, they'll be more specific now:**
- ❌ Missing nonce - invalid state
- ❌ Unable to fetch Apple ID token
- ❌ Firebase authentication failed

## 🎯 **Verification Checklist**

Check these in order:

- [ ] **"Sign In with Apple" capability added in Xcode**
- [ ] **Apple Developer Portal App ID has Sign in with Apple enabled**
- [ ] **Bundle identifier matches exactly**
- [ ] **Clean build and fresh install**
- [ ] **Testing on physical device**
- [ ] **Apple ID has 2FA enabled**
- [ ] **Apple ID signed in to device Settings**

## 🔍 **Advanced Debugging**

If still failing, check these:

### **Firebase Configuration:**
- Ensure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is added to project
- Verify Firebase project has Apple Sign-In enabled
- Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method → Apple

### **Provisioning Profile:**
- Ensure provisioning profile includes Sign in with Apple entitlement
- May need to regenerate after enabling capability

### **Xcode Console Output:**
With the new logging, you should see detailed error messages that pinpoint the exact issue.

## 🚀 **Expected Success Flow**

After fixing the configuration:

1. **Tap "Sign in with Apple"** → Apple's native sign-in sheet appears
2. **Complete Apple authentication** → Face ID/Touch ID/password
3. **See success logs in console** → Detailed step-by-step progress
4. **Return to app** → User profile appears in Settings
5. **Data syncs** → Reading progress and preferences sync via Firebase

## 📱 **Testing Different Scenarios**

Test these scenarios after configuration:

1. **First-time sign-in** → Should prompt for name/email sharing
2. **Subsequent sign-ins** → Should be quick and automatic
3. **Sign out and sign in again** → Should work seamlessly
4. **Different Apple ID** → Should create new account

## 🎉 **Expected Result**

After following these steps, your Apple Sign-In should work perfectly, and you'll see your user profile in the Settings page instead of the "Guest User" placeholder.

The enhanced error handling and logging will help identify any remaining issues quickly!
