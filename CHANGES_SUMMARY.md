# âœ… Changes Summary - Mood Diary Improvements

## ðŸŽ‰ All Issues Fixed!

I've implemented all the requested features:

---

## âœ… 1. Book Selection Option - FIXED

### Problem:
- Book selection was not appearing

### Solution:
Added a clickable book picker with:
- Shows current reading book
- Lists recent books
- Custom book entry option
- Clean selection interface

### Implementation:
```swift
Button(action: { showingBookPicker = true }) {
    Text(selectedBook.isEmpty ? "No book selected" : selectedBook)
}
.sheet(isPresented: $showingBookPicker) {
    BookPickerView(selectedBook: $selectedBook)
}
```

## âœ… 2. Emotion Selection Bug - FIXED

### Problem:
- Selecting one emotion selected all emotions

### Solution:
Fixed the button binding by removing the custom `EmotionButton` wrapper and using direct button logic:

```swift
Button(action: {
    if selectedEmotions.contains(emotion) {
        selectedEmotions.remove(emotion)
    } else {
        selectedEmotions.insert(emotion)
    }
}) {
    // Button content
}
```

### How It Works Now:
- âœ… Each emotion independently selectable
- âœ… Toggle on/off works correctly
- âœ… Visual state updates properly
- âœ… No unwanted selections
