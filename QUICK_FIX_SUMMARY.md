# 🎉 Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ What I Fixed

**Problem:** Book text wasn't loading when users tried to read stories from the app.

**Solution:** 
1. ✅ Changed to **direct Gutenberg URLs** (your recommendation was spot on!)
2. ✅ Added **text cleaning** to remove license headers
3. ✅ Added **Error handling** with debug logging

## 📝 What Changed

### Before:
- Used Gutendex API formats (unreliable)
- Got HTML or broken URLs
- No text cleaning

### After:
- Uses: `https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/{id}/pg{id}.txt`
- Plain text (.txt) format ✅
- Auto-cleans Gutenberg license text ✅
- Works instantly ✅
