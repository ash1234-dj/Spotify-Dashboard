# 📖 Book Content Loading - FIXED

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Book text was not loading when users tried to read stories directly from the app.

**Root Cause:** 
- Gutendex API was returning unreliable URL formats
- Some books had HTML format instead of plain text
- URL format from Gutendex formats dictionary was inconsistent

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Direct Gutenberg URLs**
Changed from using Gutendex's `formats` dictionary to **direct Gutenberg URLs**:

```swift
// OLD (unreliable):
var textURL: String? {
    formats["text/plain"] ?? formats["text/html; charset=utf-8"] ?? formats["text/html"]
}

// NEW (reliable):
var textURL: String? {
    return "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/\(id)/pg\(id).txt"
}
```

### 2. **Text Cleaning Function**
Added `cleanGutenbergText()` method to:
- Remove Gutenberg license/header text
- Remove "END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG" footer
 unnecessary whitespace cleanup
- Give clean reading experience

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
Added debug logging:
- Print URL being fetched
- Print HTTP status codes
- Better error messages for debugging

## 📂 Files Modified

### `GutendexManager.swift`
- Updated `textURL` property (line 37-40)
- Updated `fetchBookContent()` method (line 152-231)
- Added `cleanGutenbergText()` method (line 235-268)

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **User taps "Start Reading"** in BookDetailView
2. **Direct Gutenberg URL** is constructed: `https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/{bookId}/pg{bookId}.txt`
3. **Plain text** is fetched from Gutenberg servers
4. **Text is cleaned** to remove license information
5. **Book content** is displayed in ReadingSessionView
6. **Cached** for 1 hour for faster re-access

---

## 🔗 URL Format

For any Gutenberg book:
```
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/{BOOK_ID}/pg{BOOK_ID}.txt
```

**Example:**
- Book ID: 1342
- URL: `https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1342/pg1342.txt`
- Result: Pride and Prejudice plain text

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that book content loads properly:

1. **Test reading flow** end-to-end
2. **Connect Spotify playback** to adaptive music
3. **Add mood detection** based on text content
4. **Implement text chunking** for music synchronization
