# 🧠 Apple Foundation Models Implementation Guide

## Overview

This app now integrates **Apple Foundation Models** - Apple's on-device large language model framework introduced at WWDC25. The Foundation Models framework provides powerful AI capabilities that run entirely on-device, ensuring privacy, offline functionality, and zero API costs.

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Mood Analysis with AI** (`MoodAnalyzer.swift`)
- Analyzes reading mood patterns
- Provides personalized insights and recommendations
- Detects emotional trends over time
- Uses structured output generation with `@Generable`

### 2. **Book Recommendations** (`FoundationModelsManager.swift`)
- AI-powered book recommendations based on reading history
- Matches books to user's emotional state
- Provides reasoning for each recommendation

### 3. **Reading Summaries**
- Generates motivational reading session summaries
- Celebrates reading progress
- Encourages continued reading

---

## 🔧 Key Features

### Foundation Models Features Used:

1. **Structured Output Generation**
   ```swift
   @Generable
   struct MoodInsight {
       let keyInsights: [String]
       let detectedPatterns: [String]
       let personalizedRecommendations: [String]
       let overallTrend: String
   }
   ```

2. **Prompt Building**
   ```swift
   let prompt = PromptBuilder {
       "You are an empathetic AI assistant..."
       "Analyze the following mood diary entries..."
   }
   ```

3. **Language Model Sessions**
   ```swift
   let session = LanguageModelSession()
   let insight = try await session.generate(prompt, type: MoodInsight.self)
   ```

4. **Graceful Fallback**
   - Automatically falls back to basic pattern analysis when Foundation Models aren't available
   - Works on all devices regardless of AI capability

---

## 📱 System Requirements

### ⚠️ Current Status:
**Foundation Models API not yet available in current SDK**
- The framework from Apple's WWDC25 video is not yet released
- Architecture is prepared and ready for when API becomes available
- Currently using enhanced pattern-based analysis

### Current Implementation:
- Works on all iOS devices using enhanced pattern analysis
- No special hardware required
- All features functional without Foundation Models

### When Foundation Models Becomes Available:
- **iOS 18.0+** or **macOS 15.0+**
- **Xcode 16.0+**
- Apple Silicon device with Apple Intelligence support
- Apple Intelligence enabled in Settings

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Availability Check
```swift
#if canImport(FoundationModels)
if #available(iOS 18.0, macOS 15.0, *) {
    // Use Foundation Models
} else {
    // Fallback to basic logic
}
#endif
```

### 2. Mood Analysis Flow
```
User adds mood entry
    ↓
MoodTracker.addEntry()
    ↓
AIInsightsGenerator.generateInsights()
    ↓
[Foundation Models Available?]
    ├─ YES → Analyze with AI (structured output)
    └─ NO  → Basic pattern analysis
    ↓
Display insights in Mood Diary
```

### 3. Visual Indicator
When Foundation Models are active, users see:
```
🧠 AI Insights [🍎 Apple Intelligence]
```

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Generate Mood Insights
```swift
let generator = AIMoodInsightsGenerator()
await generator.generateInsights(from: moodEntries)
```

### Get Book Recommendations
```swift
let manager = FoundationModelsManager()
await manager.generateRecommendations(
    basedOn: moodEntries,
    availableBooks: gutendexBooks
)
```

### Generate Reading Summary
```swift
let summary = await manager.generateReadingSummary(for: moodEntry)
```

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

✅ **All processing happens on-device**
- No data sent to external servers
- No API keys required
- No internet connection needed

✅ **User data remains private**
- Mood entries stay on device
- Reading patterns never leave device
- AI analysis happens locally

✅ **No additional app size**
- Foundation Models is part of the OS
- Zero impact on app bundle size

---

## 🚀 Performance Benefits

### Based on Apple's Recommendations:

1. **Pre-warming** (Future Enhancement)
   ```swift
   session.prewarm(promptPrefix: "Analyze mood entries...")
   ```

2. **Prompt Optimization**
   - Exclude schemas when using examples
   - Reduce token count for faster responses

3. **Streaming Responses** (Future Enhancement)
   ```swift
   for try await partial in session.streamResponse(to: prompt) {
       // Update UI in real-time
   }
   ```
