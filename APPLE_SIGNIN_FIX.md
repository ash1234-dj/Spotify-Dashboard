# üçé Fixing Apple Sign-In Error 1000

## üö® **Current Error Analysis**
Your screenshot shows: `Apple Sign-In failed: The operation couldn't be completed. (com.apple.AuthenticationServices.AuthorizationError error 1000.)`

**Error 1000 = AuthorizationError.unknown** - This is typically a **configuration issue**, not a code issue.

## ‚úÖ **Required Fixes**

### **Step 1: Enable "Sign in with Apple" Capability**

1. **Open your Xcode project**
2. **Select your target** (Music Story Companion)
3. **Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab**
4. **Click "+ Capability"**
5. **Add "Sign In with Apple"**
6. **Ensure it shows as enabled**

### **Step 2: Configure Apple Developer Portal**

1. **Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)**
2. **Navigate to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"**
3. **Click "Identifiers"**
4. **Select your App ID**
5. **Enable "Sign In with Apple"**
6. **Click "Configure"** and set it up
7. **Save the configuration**

### **Step 3: Update Bundle Identifier**

Ensure your bundle identifier in Xcode matches exactly what's configured in Apple Developer Portal.

### **Step 4: Test on Physical Device**

Apple Sign-In has limitations on simulator. **Test on a real iOS device for best results.**

### **Step 5: Check Apple ID Account**

- Use an Apple ID that has **two-factor authentication enabled**
- Ensure the Apple ID is **not restricted** or **child account**
- Try with a **different Apple ID** if issues persist

## üîß **Code Improvements Based on Apple Documentation**

The code implementation should be updated to follow Apple's exact recommendations.

## üì± **Testing Steps**

1. **Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Delete app from device**
3. **Build and install fresh**
4. **Test Apple Sign-In on physical device**
5. **Check Xcode console for detailed error logs**

## üéØ **Expected Result**

After these fixes:
- ‚úÖ Apple Sign-In should work without error 1000
- ‚úÖ User profile should appear in Settings
- ‚úÖ Firebase authentication should complete successfully

## üîç **If Still Failing**

Check Xcode console output for more detailed error messages that might provide additional clues about the specific configuration issue.
